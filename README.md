This is my boilerplate for React + Browserify + Gulp + Docker

To use this, clone it to a folder named for your project.

In that folder, clone in your project to the src dir.

You will need to do an npm install in both the top dir and the src dir.

Your src dir should have the following files:
  index.html 
  server.js 
  js folder (not required)
  css folder (not required)
  fonts folder (not required)

Your server.js needs to be a module with an init function that takes in an express app and builds the needed routes.
You can also define a port variable within your server.js module.
