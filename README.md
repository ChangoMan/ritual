# ritual

This is my boilerplate for React + Webpack + Docker.

To use this, clone it to a folder named for your project.
```
git clone https://github.com/austintgriffith/ritual.git #YOURPROJECTNAME#
```

In that folder, clone your project into the src folder:
```
cd #YOURPROJECTNAME#; git clone https://github.com/austintgriffith/boiler.git src
```
